					<h1 class="sub-title">SEMESTER 1</h1>
					<p>The first semester of entering university. At first, I was afraid that I can't do it but somehow, 
					I manage to overcome the fear. I became the person who I really want to be, which is 'brave to stand alone'.
					I don't want to studying far away from home, because i have the thoughts "what if something happen at home?" 
					"can i decide anything without my parents here?" but the environment make me in loved with it.</p>

					<h1 class="sub-title">SEMESTER 2</h1>
					<p>In the second semester, I haven't had a lot of friends, it just me and my roommates. I started be the group leader in every group assignment, but 					the cons from it people are afraid to be my groupmates because I am very strict in order to make my works perfect. But the pros from it, I always 					get compliments from lecturer about my works and I get dean atleast... </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "about-col-2">
					<h1 class="sub-title">SEMESTER 3</h1>
					<p>Where my stress began. I'am not ready the semester because I play a lot. I didn't focus much in class, and it was hard. Especially in the 						progamming class. I didn't have basic knowledge, but I acted like already pro in it. I didn't study for the exam, and sleep whenever I'am facing 					problems. From the experiance, I started study hard again and don't want to repeat the same mistake.</p>

					<h1 class="sub-title">SEMESTER 4</h1>
					<p>I can't believe it almost the end of my diploma era. I love it here, nothing makes me regreats except for I didn't study hard. I have so many 					friends. We have been through many experiance together in university's life. I hope my diploma memories will always stick in my mind and not 						forgotting any single of it. </p>
